# Full Stack Open 2020 submissions

This repository will contain all my submissions for the [Full Stack Open 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) MOOC _(see  [https://www.mooc.fi/en](https://www.mooc.fi/en))_.

The repository's structure is analogous to the [11 parts of the course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents) _(excluding part 0)_. Each part is divided into various projects that contain the solutions for course exercises and the corresponding exercises are mentioned in each project's _README_. Since the exercises build upon each other, only the final result will be shown.

_(Part 0 is missing as it was submitted for an earlier iteration of this course)_

### To begin

Run `npm install && npm start` 
in any project's folder to start the development server and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). _In later projects this may require additional steps._

## Repository structure

```
.
└── part1
    ├── anecdotes
    ├── courseinfo
    └── unicafe

```

This will be filled in when more exercises have been solved.
